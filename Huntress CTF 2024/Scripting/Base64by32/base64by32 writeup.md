## Challenge Description
This is a dumb challenge. I'm sorry.


## Solve 
As the challenge only says its a dumb challenge, it is a dumb challenge. I had to download the zip file named base64by32.zip in that there is a text file that is encoded with base64. The funny part is its encoded 32 times. You need to decode 32 times and retrieve the flag. 

I will upload the solves in the same repo. 


**Flag Found:- flag{8b3980f3d33f2ad2f531f5365d0e3970}**
